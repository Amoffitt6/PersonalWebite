                    <p>My name is Adrianna Moffitt and I am a 24 year old aspiring web developer. After getting my Associates Culinary Arts and working in the restaurant industry for years, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't for me. I started to lose the love and passion I have for food. So, I decided to turn it around and make a career shift with the goal to combine web developement and culinary together. I plan to start up my own website where I can blog, create recipes, and video tutorials to help spread the love of food from meals all over the world.  </p>
